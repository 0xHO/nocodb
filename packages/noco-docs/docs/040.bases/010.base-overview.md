In NocoDB, bases are the foundational elements that encompass tables, views, forms, reports, dashboards, and automations, providing a structured framework for data organization and collaborative work. It's essential to understand that each base is inherently tied to a specific workspace and cannot be transferred between different workspaces. The creator of a base is designated as the 'base owner,' and this ownership status is non-transferable, conferring exclusive authority over the base, including the ability to delete it.

Bases also come with their unique set of collaborators and access permissions, which take precedence over any permissions set at the workspace level. This fine-grained control allows for tailored collaboration and data management within each base. Importantly, there are no restrictions on the number of collaborators you can invite to a base, fostering open teamwork. Similarly, you have the freedom to create as many tables as needed within a single base, offering the scalability required to accommodate diverse datasets and projects. 

[//]: # (Bases are the core building blocks of NocoDB. A base is a collection of tables, views, forms, reports, dashboards, and automations. You can create multiple bases to organize your data and collaborators. Some of the key points to note about bases are:)
[//]: # (- A base can be a part of only one workspace & cannot be moved between workspaces.)
[//]: # (- Creator of a base is the `base owner`. There can be only one `base owner` &#40;non-transferable&#41;.)
[//]: # (- Only base owner has the authority to delete a base.)
[//]: # (- Each base has its own set of collaborators and access permissions.)
[//]: # (- Collaborator permissions at base level carry higher precedence than workspace level permissions.)
[//]: # (- There is no limit to the number of collaborators you can invite to your base.)
[//]: # (- There is no limit to the number of tables you can create within a base.)

## Base Dashboard

The Base Dashboard serves as the primary landing page for a base, offering users a concise summary of its contents and functionality. This central hub provides users with swift access to essential features such as base settings and collaboration tools. To access the Base Dashboard, simply click on the base name located in the left sidebar.

The Base Dashboard is organized into three key sections, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. **Table List**: This section provides a comprehensive list of all tables within the base, including those sourced from external data repositories. Users can conveniently access a specific table by clicking on its name. Tables originating from external sources are clearly highlighted in the list for easy identification.

2. **Base Collaborators**: In this section, users can view a roster of collaborators associated with the base, along with their respective permission levels. It's worth noting that collaborators who are part of the workspace automatically inherit access permissions at the base level. However, the base owner retains the ability to adjust these permissions, either increasing or decreasing them. Further details on collaboration management can be found in the dedicated [Base Collaborations](base-collaboration) section.

3. **Data Sources**: NocoDB offers the functionality to connect with external data sources and seamlessly integrate them as native tables. This section provides a listing of connected data sources, setting the stage for additional details on this feature, which will be covered in the forthcoming [Data Sources](/data-source/data-source-overview) section. This feature empowers users to work with external data as effortlessly as with in-house data tables, enhancing the versatility and scope of data management within the base.


[//]: # (Base dashboard has the following sections:)
[//]: # (### Table List)
[//]: # (List of tables in the base. Click on the table name to open the table. A base can consist of tables residing in external data sources as well. They are highlighted accordingly in the table list. )
[//]: # (### Base Collaborators)
[//]: # (List of collaborators in the base along with their current permission levels. Workspace collaborators inherit their access permissions to the base. Base owner can modify the permissions of collaborators at base level &#40;either bump up or bump down&#41;. Additional details will be dealt with in section [Base Collaborations]&#40;/docs/040.bases/075.base-collaboration.md&#41;.)
