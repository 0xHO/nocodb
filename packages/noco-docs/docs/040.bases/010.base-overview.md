Bases are the core building blocks of NocoDB. A base is a collection of tables, views, forms, reports, dashboards, and automations. You can create multiple bases to organize your data and collaborators. Some of the key points to note about bases are:
- A base can be a part of only one workspace & cannot be moved between workspaces.
- Creator of a base is the `base owner`. There can be only one `base owner` (non-transferable).
- Only base owner has the authority to delete a base.
- Each base has its own set of collaborators and access permissions.
- Collaborator permissions at base level carry higher precedence than workspace level permissions.
- There is no limit to the number of collaborators you can invite to your base.
- There is no limit to the number of tables you can create within a base.

## Base Dashboard

Base dashboard is the landing page for a base. It provides a quick overview of the base. It also provides quick access to base settings & collaborations. Click on the base name in the left sidebar **<1>** to open the base dashboard **<2>**.

Base dashboard has the following sections:
### Table List
List of tables in the base. Click on the table name to open the table. A base can consist of tables residing in external data sources as well. They are highlighted accordingly in the table list. 
### Base Collaborators
List of collaborators in the base along with their current permission levels. Workspace collaborators inherit their access permissions to the base. Base owner can modify the permissions of collaborators at base level (either bump up or bump down). Additional details will be dealt with in section [Base Collaborations](/docs/040.bases/075.base-collaboration.md).
### Data Sources
NocoDB allows you to connect to external data sources & work with them as if they are native tables. List of connected data sources are listed here. Additional details will be dealt with in section [Data Sources](/docs/050.data-sources/010.data-sources-overview.md).
