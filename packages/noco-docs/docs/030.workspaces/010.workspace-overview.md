NocoDB workspaces are a crucial feature for organizing and managing your data effectively:

1. **Workspace Isolation**: Each workspace contains its own set of bases, keeping your data separate and well-organized.

2. **Member Control**: Workspaces have their own members and permissions, allowing you to control who can access and modify data within each workspace.

3. **Customized Settings**: Workspaces offer unique settings and billing options, letting you customize configurations to suit specific needs.

4. **Base Association**: Bases are tied exclusively to one workspace and can't be moved between workspaces, ensuring data integrity.

5. **Member Flexibility**: Members can be part of multiple workspaces, enabling versatile collaboration across different bases. You can also fine-tune their roles within each workspace.

In summary, NocoDB workspaces streamline data management and member control, providing the flexibility and oversight necessary for various projects and teams.

You can easily switch between different workspaces by simply clicking on the respective workspace name within this menu.
