In NocoDB, workspaces serve as collections of one or more bases, offering a structured approach to organizing your data and collaborators. Here are some key aspects to keep in mind regarding workspaces:

1. **Workspace Isolation**: Each workspace maintains its distinct set of bases, ensuring separation and organization of your data.

2. **Collaborator Management**: Workspaces come with their own group of collaborators and access permissions. This allows you to precisely control who can interact with your data within each workspace.

3. **Customized Settings**: Each workspace offers individualized settings and billing plans, providing flexibility to tailor configurations to specific needs.

4. **Base Affiliation**: A base is exclusively associated with one workspace and cannot be transferred between workspaces, preserving data integrity.

5. **Collaborator Flexibility**: Collaborators can be members of multiple workspaces, enabling versatile collaboration across different projects. Additionally, collaborators can have varying access permissions within distinct workspaces, allowing you to fine-tune their roles as needed.

In essence, workspaces in NocoDB facilitate effective data organization and collaboration management, ensuring that you have the flexibility and control required for various projects and teams.

The self-hosted plan includes a default workspace, and it does not allow the creation of additional workspaces.
