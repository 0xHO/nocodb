Workspaces in NocoDB are collection of one or more [Bases](/bases/base-overview). You can create multiple workspaces to organize your bases and collaborators. Some of the key points to note about workspaces are:
- Each workspace has its own set of bases.
- Each workspace has its own set of collaborators and access permissions.
- Each workspace has its own set of settings & billing plans
- A base can be a part of only one workspace & cannot be moved between workspaces.
- A collaborator can be a member of multiple workspaces.
- A collaborator can have different access permissions in different workspaces.

:::info
You can create only one workspace in the self-hosted plan (default).
