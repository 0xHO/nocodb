In NocoDB, bases are organized within workspaces. To build database schema or to work with tables, fields and data in a base, your initial step involves either creating a new workspace or receiving an invitation to join an existing one, typically extended by a workspace owner.

In the following section, we will guide you through the process of creating your NocoDB workspaces.

## Create a workspace

1. Click on the **Workspace name** on the top of left sidebar to open **Workspace context menu**.
2. Select **Create workspace** button on the Workspace context menu.
3. Enter the **Workspace name** and click on the **Create Workspace** button

Upon the creation of a new workspace, you are automatically designated as the workspace owner. Once your workspace is established, you have the authority to create bases and tables into it, as well as extend invitations to collaborators for participation. 

- There is no limit to the number of collaborators you can invite to your workspace. 
- There is also no limit to the number of bases you can create within a workspace. 
- There can be only one workspace owner (non-transferable).
- Only workspace owner has the authority to delete a workspace.

:::info
- You can create only one workspace in the self-hosted plan (default).
- On signup, a default workspace is created for you. You can rename it or create a new one.
