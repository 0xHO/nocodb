In NocoDB, bases are organized within workspaces. To build database schema or to work with tables, fields and data in a base, your initial step involves either creating a new workspace or receiving an invitation to join an existing one, typically extended by a workspace owner.

In the following section, we will guide you through the process of creating your NocoDB workspaces.

## Create a workspace

1. Navigate to the top-left corner of the sidebar and select the **Workspace name** to access the **Workspace context menu**.
2. From the Workspace context menu, opt for the **Create workspace** button.
3. Provide a name for the workspace, then proceed by clicking the **Create Workspace** button.

When you start a new workspace, you automatically become the owner. Once your workspace is set up, you can [create tables](/tables/create-table) and [invite others](/workspaces/workspace-collaboration) to join and work together. You can invite as many people as you want, and you can create as many tables as you need in your workspace. But remember, there can only be one owner, and only the owner can delete the workspace. Upon registration, an initial workspace is automatically generated on your behalf. You have the ability to either [modify its name](/workspaces/actions-on-workspace#rename-workspace) or establish an entirely new workspace.

:::info
The self-hosted plan includes a default workspace, and it does not allow the creation of additional workspaces.
