`Lookup` fields help bring additional field information from related table into the current table. This is useful when you want to display additional information about a record in a table. For example, if you have a table of `Orders` and a table of `Customers`, you can use a `Lookup` field to display the customer's name and address in the `Orders` table.

## Create a Lookup Field

## Create field
