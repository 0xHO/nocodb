## Keyboard navigation within Grid view

A selected cell can be in one of the following states:
1. `Select` state : A single click on the cell selects the cell. When in this state, arrow keys can be used to navigate to adjacent cells.
2. `Edit` state : A double click on the cell puts the cell in edit state. Cursor can be moved within the cell using arrow keys.

:::note
- Double-click on a cell to put it in edit state directly.
- From Select state, press `Enter` key to enter edit state.
- Press `Esc` key to exit edit state.
- From Edit state, press `Enter` key to save the changes.
::: 

Edit state for some cells will be a picker. For example, a cell with `Single Select` field type will have a picker with options to choose from. In such cases, arrow keys can be used to navigate between options.
