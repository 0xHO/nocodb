`Views` in NocoDB offer versatile ways to showcase and interact with your data. NocoDB provides multiple view types to cater to different needs, enabling you to independently sort and filter records within each view. Each view maintains its unique meta configurations for filter, data & enabled fields, ensuring changes in one view won't impact others.

:::info
View represents data from a table. Any updates to records in a view will be reflected in all other views of the same table.

## View Types

### Grid View

Grid View, as a default type of view, allows you to display your data in a spreadsheet-like interface using rows and columns. Rows are as referred to as records and columns as fields in NocoDB.

You can drag-drop fields from the form to form-field-menu-bar as required.

### Gallery View

Gallery View allows you to display images as thumbnails with other fields just like a gallery.

## View Permission Types

We can apply permission to each View. By default, views are `Collaborative`. To see or change the view type, expand `view-tool-bar-menu` as shown below.
