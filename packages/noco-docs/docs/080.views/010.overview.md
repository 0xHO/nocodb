`View` often represents a way to display your data. NocoDB provides different types of views to display your data in different ways. You can also Sort or Filter records within a View. Each View is independent, which means the configuration applying to View 1 will not apply to View 2.

## View Types

### Grid View

Grid View, as a default type of view, allows you to display your data in a spreadsheet-like interface.

### Form View

Form View allows you to arrange fields in a form to input data.

You can drag-drop columns from the form to form-field-menu-bar as required.

### Gallery View

Gallery View allows you to display images as thumbnails with other fields just like a gallery.

### Kanban View

Kanban View allows you to visualise your data using cards at various stacks.

## View Permission Types

We can apply permission to each View. By default, Collaborative Views will be used. To see or change the view type, expand `view-tool-bar-menu` as shown below.
