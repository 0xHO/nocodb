`Views` in NocoDB offer versatile ways to showcase and interact with your data. NocoDB provides multiple view types to cater to different needs, enabling you to independently sort and filter records within each view. Each view maintains its unique meta configurations for filter, data & enabled fields, ensuring changes in one view won't impact others.

:::info
View represents data from a table. Any updates to records in a view will be reflected in all other views of the same table.

## View Types

1. [Grid View](view-types/grid)
2. [Form View](view-types/form)
3. [Gallery View](view-types/gallery)
4. [Kanban View](view-types/kanban)


## View Permission Types

We can apply permission to each View. By default, views are `Collaborative`. To see or change the view type, expand `view-tool-bar-menu` as shown below.

### Collaborative Views (default)
By default, views are set to "Collaborative," allowing members with edit permissions or higher to modify view configurations. In this mode, all members can read and write data to the view. This is the default mode for all views.

### Locked Views
With "Locked Views," no one can edit the view configurations until they are unlocked. In this mode, all members are restricted to reading data from the view and are unable to make any changes to its settings or content. This mode is useful when you want to share a view with others but don't want them to make any changes to it.
