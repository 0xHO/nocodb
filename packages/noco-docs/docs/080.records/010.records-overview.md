Records in NocoDB are fundamental components within a database, serving as individual entries or data points within a table. Each default table in NocoDB is meticulously organized into a structured grid of records, fields (columns), and cells. These records constitute the backbone of data storage and retrieval within NocoDB, encapsulating a diverse range of information types, including text, numerical values, dates, file attachments, and even hyperlinks to other records, either within the same table or across different tables. This versatile approach allows users to create highly customizable databases tailored to their specific data management needs, all centered around the concept of records.

In essence, a record can be envisaged as a horizontal collection of data within a NocoDB table, each record representing a distinct piece of information. These records play a pivotal role in organizing, categorizing, and presenting data in a comprehensible and efficient manner, offering users a structured and organized platform for data management. 

In this section, we'll explore the various aspects of records in NocoDB, equipping you with the knowledge to effectively manage your own data.
