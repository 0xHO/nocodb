When you opt for self-hosting, you gain the advantage of running an application on a server that you have direct control over. This grants you the flexibility to choose whether to host the database on your premises or within a server leased from a data center. In this self-administered arrangement, typically found on-premises, you assume full responsibility for the management and upkeep of your server. This level of control ensures that you have complete authority over all aspects of your data and services, eliminating any reliance on third-party service providers. This option is ideal for organizations that require a high degree of control over their data and services, but it does necessitate a higher level of technical expertise.

Setting up NocoDB on your own server is a straightforward process & the articles below will guide you through the steps to get started.
