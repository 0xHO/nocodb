Once the password is successfully entered and authenticated, you will gain access to the shared view.
In the event that the URL is not password-protected, you will be directed to the shared view directly, without the need for a password.

Users with the shared view link can only view the data and cannot make any changes to the view or its content. Records and fields in the shared view will be updated in real-time as changes are made to the original view. Users accessing shared view can apply filters and sort records as per their requirements.

:::info
Note that, filters & sorts applied to shared view will not be persisted. These filters & sorts will be reset when the shared view is accessed again.
