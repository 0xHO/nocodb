The Self-hosted plan includes a default workspace, and it does not allow the creation of additional workspaces. And hence, the user management on Self-Hosted plan is different from other plans. This article details the specifics of User management on Self-Hosted plan.

## User Management
Self-hosted plan equivalent of a workspace is an organisation. An organisation can have multiple bases. Permissions within NocoDB are divided into two levels: `Organisation level` and `Base level`.

### Organisation Level Permissions:
- `Org Level Creator`: Allows users to create new bases and access invited bases.
- `Org Level Viewer`: Allows users to access invited bases but does not permit the creation of new bases.

### Base Level Permissions:
The permissions at base level on self-hosted plans are similar to other plans. The base level permissions are summarized below:

- `Owner`: The user who created the project. A project can have only one owner. The owner persists until the project exists and the role is non-transferable. The owner has access to carry out any operations within the project, including deleting it.
- `Creator`: Has access to carry out any operations within the project except deleting the project and removing the "Owner."
- `Editor`: Can modify data but cannot modify the schema (add/remove columns, tables, users, and such).
- `Commenter`: Can neither modify data nor schema, can only see data and can mark row-level comments.
- `Viewer`: Can only see data.

Please note that the above-mentioned Base Level Permissions are additional to the already defined Organisation Level Permissions.

In addition to the previously defined permissions, NocoDB also includes the role of `Super Admin`. The `Super Admin` is the first user to sign up on this NocoDB installation. An organisation can have only one `Super Admin` and this role is non-transferable. The `Super Admin` will have the equivalent permissions of an "Org Level Creator" and "Owner" for all projects within the organisation.
