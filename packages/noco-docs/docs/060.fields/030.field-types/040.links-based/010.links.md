`Links` field type is used to establish relationship between tables & create links to other records. 
NocoDB supports following types of relations:
- `Has-Many` - A record in one table can have multiple records in another table. 
  - Example: A `Country` can have multiple `Cities`.
- `Belongs-to` - Multiple records in one table can have a single record in another table. 
  - Example: A `City` `Belongs-to` a `Country`.
- `Many-to-Many` - Multiple records in one table can have multiple records in another table. 
  - Example: A `Student` can have multiple `Subjects` & a `Subject` can have multiple `Students`. 

:::note
- Links can be created only between tables in the same database.
- Self-referencing links are supported. (Link to the same table)
- For every `Has-Many` relation defined, NocoDB augments `Belongs-to` relationship column in the adjacent table automatically
