## Pull Request Guidelines

- When you create a PR, you should fill in all the info defined in this [template](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md).

- The `master` branch is just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. 
**Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `develop`, and merge back against that branch.

- Multiple small commits are allowed on the PR - They will be squashed into one commit before merging.

- If your changes are related to a special issue, add `ref: #xxx` to link the issue where xxx is the issue id.
